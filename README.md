Further Data was transformed to get clean and suitable data which can be fed to regression models. The model applied over the given dataset were K-neighbors Regressor, Linear Regression and XGBoost. For linear regression, K- Fold cross validation was applied whereas in KNN, Ten-fold cross validation was applied to obtain best K value. The models were evaluated based on R-Sqaure, Adjusted R-Square, Mean Square Error, Root Mean Square Error & Mean Absolut Error where Linear Regression got better results.
